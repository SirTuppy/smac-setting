*Last updated: 2026-02-03*

## 1. Setter Wellness & Operations (Backburner)
- [ ] **Load/Injury Monitoring**
    - *Strategic Note*: This would significantly benefit from a self-reporting (likely external) tool to capture qualitative data like fatigue or minor aches.

## 2. Tooling & UX (Medium Term)
- [ ] **Mobile/Tablet Optimization**: Responsive layouts for tablet reference during setting.

## 3. Technical Debt & Quality (Long Term)
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Efficient handling of multi-year datasets through selective processing.

## 4. Fix Yellow Maps
- [ ] **Fix printing**: Printing/generating PDF of multiple maps begins a slow vertical cascade of maps onto multiple pages. Each map must be its own page.
- [ ] **Redo for high resolution maps**: Stretch goal, exactly what it sounds like. Don't do until everything else is complete.
